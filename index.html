                <h2>The Road Not Taken – Robert Frost</h2>
                <p>“I shall be telling this with a sigh<br/>
                    Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br/>
                    Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-<br/>
                    I took the one less traveled by,<br/>
                    And that has made all the difference.”<br/><br/>
                    
                    Robert Frost, regarded by many as one of America’s greatest poets, 
                    wrote this adventure poem which has no doubt inspired more travels 
                    than we could ever know. It’s a call to courage, to face the unknown, 
                    and to break from the crowd and follow your own path wherever it may 
                    lead. </p>

                <h2>Song of the Open Road – Walt Whitman</h2>
                <p>“Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road, <br/>
                    Healthy, free, the world before me, <br/>
                    The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose. <br/>
                    Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune, <br/>
                    Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing, <br/>
                    Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms, <br/>
                    Strong and content I travel the open road.”</p>

                <h2>Freedom – Olive Runner</h2>
                <p>“Give me the long, straight road before me,<br/>
                    A clear, cold day with a nipping air, <br/>
                    Tall, bare trees to run on beside me, <br/>
                    A heart that is light and free from care. <br/>
                    Then let me go!-I care not whither <br/>
                    My feet may lead, for my spirit shall be <br/>
                    Free as the brook that flows to the river, <br/>
                    Free as the river that flows to the sea.” <br/><br/>
                    
                    Oliver Runner’s poem about adventure captures so much of what drives 
                    every traveler. The sense of untethered wandering, free to go where 
                    the road may lead. As long as we’re treading new ground and experiencing 
                    new places, we’re at our happiest. </p>
